# odin-landingPage
 It's time to create the second Odin project!

 What have I learned?
 - Flexbox and Responsive design are still some pain for me. However, I practiced polishing imperfections to the possible at the moment degree without extra help of tutorials (just Google search). In addition, I started feeling the structure of the web better and now I can see not just lots of areas to improve, but also the ways to maintain my skills. Thanks!
